Development Lead
================

* Markus Juenemann (markus@juenemann.net)

Contributors
============

* Eliot Blennerhassett contributed code, lots of really good ideas and reminded me
  that other people may use *python-TSIP* in ways I hadn't even anticipated.
* Thanks to Jonathan Eisch for making me re-start working on this project again.
* Daniel Macia Fernandez inspired me to work on "obscure" TSIP packets I never
  though anyone would ever be interested in. The file `docs/examples/example2.py`
  is loosely based on code we worked on together.
